<h1>The socially acceptable exchange of healthcare workers from Kenya to Germany</h1>
<p>The team at the FundiKipusa think tank is observing the current trend in labor migration from Kenya with great concern.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the need for workers for the healthcare system in Germany will be significant in the next few years.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is also an undersupply of public healthcare in Kenya. Kenya is developing and according to our analyses, it will take about 10 years before a status quo is reached in which the public sector in Kenya has a social network to ensure socially insured health care and care on its own.</ p>
<p>In Germany, on the other hand, there is a lack of willing workers for the sector. This is due to the demographic change and the unregulated situation on the labor market, with regard to the activation of immigrants from crisis areas for the German labor market.</p>
<p>For this internal problem in Germany, a solution must and should be found from within within the next 10 years.</p>
<p>It can't be right to use a lot of money and lure offers to skim off workers in the global South in a post-colonial way. We take the approach that an exchange program can be a solution in the short term, but in the long term the interests of everyone must be maintained.</p>
<p>The situation: in Germany we have a rapidly growing demographic change. This results in an increased need for nursing care and nursing staff. This gap cannot currently be solved internally due to the job profile and the limited use of immigrant workers. However, a time frame of 10 years should definitely be enough to solve this now latent problem. The exploitation of the global South cannot serve as a starting point. This is wrong in every way.</p>

<p>In Kenya: Kenya is developing at great speed into a functional democratic country with sufficient social security. This process is far from complete, but according to our research, a time frame of 10 years seems absolutely realistic:</p>
<p>The morally and etically correct solution according to FundiKipusa guidelines.</p>
<ul class="health-list">
    <li class="health-list-items">Kenya can send healthcare workers to Germany. But a permanent emigration of Kenyans from systemically important professions will hinder the country's development in the long term.</li>
    <li class="health-list-items">A limited stay of 10 years, with at the same time close ties to the home country, will produce both the necessary foreign exchange for Kenya and the opportunity to further train local staff in the functioning system in Germany .
    </li>
    <li class="health-list-items">Instead of the completely unsatisfactory development work of the German government, service providers can initially close the acute gap through the FundiKipusa Program. At the same time, the 10-year agreement also secures help for Kenya, because better educated workers will come back to the Kenyan market after their stay abroad. These workers can then be used directly on site for training and responsible management positions.</li>
</ul>


<p>With its parkmatic approach, FundiKipusa has created many sustainable jobs in Kenya. Our story speaks for itself.</p>
<p>With Stephen Mc.Cormick LTD, FundiKipusa CBO has now established a commercial partner in the private sector. This applies to all Mc’s transactions. Cormick LTD the sustainable principles of FundiKipusa CBO.</p>
<h3>What exactly does the labor exchange program look like?</h3>
<ul class="health-list">
    <li class="health-list-items">Stephen Mc.Cormick LTD has legally registered in Germany and in the transparency register. With our Mr. Abbas Nargessi and Mr. Heino Dahmen, we have a local presence in Germany and can directly supervise and support exchange candidates from Kenya.</li>
    <li class="health-list-items">The representatives in Germany can establish direct contact with potential employers and can also provide direct contact with candidates from Kenya. This essentially prevents people in economic need from Kenya from being exploited or defrauded by dubious offers. Only verified direct contacts can lead to the conclusion of employment contracts.</li>
    <li class="health-list-items">As a Kenyan company, Stephen Mc.Cormick LTD, in collaboration with FundiKipusa CBO, can identify local candidates whose private situation has a lasting limitation

        Staying in Germany is possible without giving up ties to your home country.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Our rules:</h3>
<ul class="health-list">
    <li class="health-list-items">The Mc. Cormick LTD selects suitable candidates from the local market and then makes them available to willing employers for extensive online interviews and pre-selection.</li>
    <li class="health-list-items">After approval from the future employer, Mc.Cormick helps the Kenyan workforce with the fulfillment of the bureaucratic requirements. The aim is to cooperate with the German authorities.</li>
    <li class="health-list-items">After meeting the requirements, the Mc. Cormick LTD acts as an intermediary for the candidates when entering the country and taking over the job and ensures the social compatibility of the agreements.</li>
